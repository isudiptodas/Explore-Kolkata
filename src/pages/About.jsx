                <p className='font-Poppins phone:text-xs md:text-s lg:text-sm xl:text-xl text-center phone:mt-3'>Kolkata, the pulsating heart of West Bengal, is a city where the ancient and modern coexist in
                    harmonious discord. Once the imperial capital of British India, it carries the indelible marks of its
                    colonial past, yet it is equally defined by its vibrant present.

                <p className='font-Poppins text-center phone:text-xs lg:text-sm'>As the former capital of British India, Kolkata is a living museum, adorned with architectural marvels like the
                    Victoria Memorial and the Howrah Bridge. These iconic structures stand as silent witnesses to the city's glorious
                    past. Yet, beneath the colonial veneer lies a city deeply rooted in its Indian heritage. Ancient temples, bustling
                    markets, and the holy Ganges river offer a stark contrast to the British-era buildings, creating a unique and
                    captivating blend of cultures.

                <p className='font-Poppins text-center phone:text-xs lg:text-sm'>Kolkata is a city that celebrates diversity. It is a literary and artistic hub, having given birth to renowned figures like
                    Rabindranath Tagore and Satyajit Ray. Tagore's Nobel Prize-winning works and Ray's cinematic masterpieces
                    have put Kolkata on the global cultural map. The city's intellectual fervor is palpable in its numerous book stores,
                    art galleries, and theaters. Music, too, finds a home in Kolkata, with its diverse range of classical, folk, and
                    contemporary genres. Rabindra Sangeet, the musical compositions of Rabindranath Tagore, is a quintessential
                    part of Kolkata's cultural identity. The city also boasts a thriving independent music scene, with bands and artists
                    experimenting with various genres.

                <h3 className='font-Montserrat font-bold lg:text-2xl'>Festivals</h3>
                <p className='font-Poppins text-center phone:text-xs lg:text-sm'>Kolkata comes alive during its festivals, which are a riot of colors, sounds, and energy. Durga Puja, the most
                    significant festival, is a grand spectacle that transforms the city into a fairyland of lights and pandals. Kali Puja,
                    another important festival, is celebrated with equal fervor. The city also hosts a variety of other festivals,
                    including Holi, Diwali, and Christmas, each with its own unique charm.

                <p className='font-Poppins text-center phone:text-xs lg:text-sm'>Despite its historical charm, Kolkata is a dynamic metropolis that is rapidly evolving. The city is experiencing a
                    renaissance, with new infrastructure, businesses, and opportunities emerging. The IT sector is thriving, and the
                    city is gradually transforming into a modern hub of commerce and technology. However, the city's challenges
                    are equally significant. Overpopulation, poverty, and infrastructure issues are problems that the city grapples
                    with. Yet, the indomitable spirit of its people continues to shine through, making Kolkata a city of resilience and
                    hope.
